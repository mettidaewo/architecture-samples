In this book, Samper presents his concept of *recinto urbano*, which he defines as "the space delimited by buildings that gives character and identity to a place, and that allows the development of multiple activities and functions that enrich the urban life"[^5^]. He argues that the *recinto urbano* is more important than the buildings themselves, and that it should be designed with care and attention to the human scale, the natural environment, the historical context and the cultural values of the inhabitants.
 
Samper illustrates his ideas with examples from his own projects and from other cities around the world. He also shares his sketches, drawings and photographs that capture his observations and reflections on urban phenomena. He shows how the *recinto urbano* can be a source of inspiration, creativity and social transformation for architects, urban planners, policy makers and citizens alike.

In his projects, Samper demonstrates his mastery of modern architecture and his sensitivity to the local context, culture and climate. He uses simple forms, natural materials, expressive structures and functional layouts to create spaces that are elegant, comfortable and adaptable. He also pays attention to the urban and landscape integration of his buildings, creating harmonious relationships between the public and private realms.
